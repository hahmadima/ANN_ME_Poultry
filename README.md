# ANN_ME_Poultry
Excel® calculator to predict the TMEn of Soybean meal for poultry using developed ANN model.


In this study, we export the developed ANN models as a C++ code and ANN_ME_poultry Excel® ME calculator to share them with the readers who might be interested to duplicate the results or to predict a new output based on SBM chemical components.
